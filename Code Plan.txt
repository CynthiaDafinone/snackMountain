Steps 
1. Python word MVP 
2. Draw concept art
3. Python to MVP with images (basic card) browser front end 
4. Try messing around in wax 
5. JS MVP (ask AJ for help)
6. Connect tester wax bits 
7. Contact Momichu or cute cheap artist to knock up concept art
8. Animation for mining 
9. Connect wax blockchain to game



1.Mining (Passive)
2.Battle (Active)
3. Adventure(Active) 
4. Metaverse (?)
Battle - home for resting bonus x2 points, staking NFTs candies. Can't stake in combat...,
Adventure - this could be meta verse complex (locations (battle arenas, potion/candy shops, mining spots,  mini games...)

NFT/Token elements
Character (NFT) Player needs to buy
Snackie / Power ups 


 claim WAX for shards > 1RCS = 000.1WAX


Without Enemies 
Character mines rocks to get rock candy they might stumble on a common  candy max 1 every 5 sessions. Characters get 1 rock every 2 seconds (rock candy shard 0.001 Wax player get - most likely use claim system) 

With Enemies 
While mining rocks sludge monsters (with potential goodies trapped in them may attack).
The player fight sludge monsters passively based on stats and single attack option (Special attacks and other power ups bestowed by candy!!). Slug monsters appear based on timer. The sludge monsters also drop candy of various colours. (Or potions or shields you have to equip them or buy them) Colours indicate rarity and value. 

Battle 
Charachters fight each other like axie but no cards 
Figure out combat later

Try running Power ups for 30 seconds - sequentially. (one then another once 5 secs after)
Try interactive power with cool down
